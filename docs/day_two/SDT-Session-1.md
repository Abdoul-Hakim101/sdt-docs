### **React.js Fundamentals and Project Development**

**Instructor**:
- **Eng. Mohamed Abdirahman Ahmed**, Software Developer at Tabaarak ICT and Rikaab

During this session, students worked on the **Track-registration** project, a real-world application built with **React.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **MongoDB**. Under the guidance of Eng. Mohamed Abdirahman Ahmed, they gained hands-on experience as they applied these technologies to create a fully functional application. The instructor provided valuable support throughout the process, helping students enhance their practical coding skills and problem-solving abilities.
