### **Admin Dashboard Frontend Development with React.js and MongoDB Atlas**

**Instructor**:
- **Eng. Hassan Omar Mohamed**, Head of Development, SIU

In this session, participants developed the **Admin Dashboard** frontend using **React.js** and connected it to **MongoDB Atlas** for database integration. Students learned how to set up the environment, install dependencies, build the app, and configure API connections using `.env` variables. The focus was on frontend development and connecting the app to a database without backend development.
