In this session, participants developed the backend for the **Track-registration** project using **Node.js**. They learned how to set up the environment, install necessary dependencies, create RESTful APIs, and integrate the backend with **MongoDB Atlas** for data storage. The focus was on backend development, API creation, and configuring the project for production use.
